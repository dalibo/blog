**The submission deadline is October 7th**.

We will post the slides on [PGSession's website](http://dali.bo/2019_site_pgsessions) after the event. 
Moreover this day will be broadcast on our [Youtube channel](https://dali.bo/dalibo_youtube), and all the lectures will be recorded and published after the Session.

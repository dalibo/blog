PEV is dead, please welcome PEV2!

[PEV2] is a graphical visualization tool to understand PostgreSQL execution
plans.

## Why PEV2?

You probably already know the simple yet excellent [Depesz]. You may also have
heard about [PEV] which is popular as well and it's deserved.

The latter is a really great tool in my opinion but unfortunately it hasn't
been actively maintained for more than 3 years now.

While searching for a javascript library to display an execution plan
into a monitoring tool ([temBoard](https://temboard.io)), I wanted to check if
PEV could make a good candidate. It was unfortunately impossible to use it as
is. It [seemed](https://github.com/AlexTatiyants/pev/commits/master)
[abandoned](https://github.com/AlexTatiyants/pev/issues/42) and didn't fully
match my needs. Thus I quickly decided
to fork it. With great and quick success, given the fact that it was really
well written. Kudos to its author.

The result can be seen at **[explain.dalibo.com]**.

## What's Inside?

To make it very quick, the new project is written using webpack, VueJS,
Typescript, Bootstrap.

Why `VueJS`? Well, it's just a matter of personal taste.

## PEV2 Can Parse TEXT Format!

Hell Yeah!

Though still to be improved, `PEV2` is able to parse an execution plan in the
default format returned by `EXPLAIN` (ie. text).

## Insights

Instead of only showing the *slowest*, *costliest* or *largest* node. I decided to
imitate what [Depesz] does by highlighting the most relevant values for duration,
cost and row estimation factor using thresholds and a color palette going from
<span style="background-color:#fe8;padding-left: 4px;padding-right: 4px;border-radius: 2px;">yellow</span> to
<span style="background-color:#800;color: white;padding-left: 4px;padding-right: 4px;border-radius: 2px;">red</span>
.

## Vue Orientation

With PEV2, you can choose the way the graph is displayed:
**2D** or **classic**. This is your preference.

That's already a lot. But stay tuned. There will be other posts to go into more
details.
